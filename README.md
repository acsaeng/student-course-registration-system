**Author:** Aron Saengchan

## Summary
A GUI-based student course registration system written using a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture. Once the user logs in, the application opens up to the main menu which contains the following options:
1. Search Course Catalog
2. Add Course to Student Courses
3. Remove Course from Student Courses
4. View All Courses in the Catalog
5. View Registered Student Courses
6. Exit

To start the program, open `src/CourseRegistrationApp.java` and run the file.
